                  All organizations that process personal data are required to comply with data protection legislation. This includes in particular
                  the Data Protection Act 1998 (or its successor) and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (together the ‘Data Protection Laws’).
                  The Data Protection Laws give individuals (known as ‘data subjects’) certain rights over their personal data whilst imposing certain
                  obligations on the organizations that process their data.

                  As a recruitment business, the Company collects and processes both personal data and sensitive personal data. It is required to do
                  so to comply with other legislation. It is also required to keep this data for different periods depending on the nature of the
                  data.

                  <li>
                    Processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest on the basis of EU or Member State law which shall be
