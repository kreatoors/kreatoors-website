Employee voices break through because they bring three essential elements that corporate messaging often lacks: authenticity, relatability, and genuine expertise. ",

          "Consider a software company launching a new feature. A polished marketing message might highlight its benefits, but when an engineer shares the problem-solving journey behind its development, that story resonates on a deeper level. It's not just about what was built – it's about the human experience of building it. "
